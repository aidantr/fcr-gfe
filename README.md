# Replication package for Lewis, Melcangi, Pilossoph, and Toner-Rodgers (2022)

This repository contains all the code to replicate the results of  "A Fuzzy Clustering Approach to Estimating Grouped Fixed-Effects." The paper is available [link]. All the files are written in Matlab.

## Required Matlab toolboxes

- Statistics and machine learning toolbox
- Optimization toolbox
- Deep learning toolbox

## How to run

The bash file runall.sh runs all the necessary Matlab files in order to reproduce the tables and figures in the paper. 

## Repository structure

- /data/raw: contains raw data files
- /data/clean: contains intermediate results
- /code: the folder /code/functions contains the Matlab functions needed to implement our estimator and the other files produce all tables and figures
- /output: stores outputs for all tables and figures in the main text and appendix
